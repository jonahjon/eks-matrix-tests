## Job Types

There are three types of prow jobs:

- **Presubmits** run against code in PRs

We use this to add in container images, and jobs

- **Postsubmits** run after merging code

We use this update parts of the infrastructure, and the job specs configmap

- **Periodics** run on a periodic basis
